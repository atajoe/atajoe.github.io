        On the north bank of the River Thames in the heart of London, England, stands the medieval fortification known as The Tower of London. It is a well-known monument and a UNESCO World Heritage site that is significant in both history and culture.
        The Tower of London, which was initially constructed in the 11th century, has had many uses over the course of its lengthy existence. It has served as a prison, treasury, armory, menagerie for exotic animals, and even a royal residence. Its most well-known use was as a jail, where noteworthy individuals like Anne Boleyn, Sir Walter Raleigh, and Guy Fawkes were imprisoned.
