        Big Ben is an iconic landmark located in London, England. Contrary to popular belief, Big Ben is actually the nickname for the Great Bell of the clock at the north end of the Palace of Westminster, which is officially known as the Elizabeth Tower. However, the name "Big Ben" is often used to refer to the entire clock tower.
        Built in 1859, Big Ben has become one of the most recognizable symbols of London and a prominent feature of its skyline. The tower stands at a height of 96 meters (315 feet) and is famous for its distinctive Gothic Revival architecture. The clock faces, measuring over 7 meters (23 feet) in diameter, are one of the largest clock faces in the world.
