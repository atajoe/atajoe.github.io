        <h1>About page</h1>
        <p>This webpage was created to educated people about London in hopes to increase tourism to England. Southeast England is home to London, which is located along the River Thames about 50 miles (80 km) upstream from its estuary on the North Sea. The metropolis appears to be tightly packed in a Green Belt of open space on satellite images, with its main ring road (the M25 motorway) encircling it at a distance of around 20 miles (30 km) from the city center. In the middle of the 1950s, rigorous town planning regulations stopped the growth of the built-up region. Its physical boundaries roughly match the administrative and statistical lines that divide Greater London's metropolitan county from the "home counties" of Kent, Surrey, and Berkshire (in clockwise order) to the south of the river and from Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire, and Essex to the north of the river.</p>
